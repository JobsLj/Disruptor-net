## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started with the disruptor is by using the [NuGet package]

## Build from source and run tests

You may also build the Disruptor directly from the source:
* You need Visual Studio 2017
* run `Cake-Build.bat`, it will compile, run the tests and output binaries and results into `\output\assembly` folder

You can also run all the performance tests by running `Cake-Perf.bat`.
